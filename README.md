## Description

This is my shot at making a spool holder for Prusa I3 Family.

## Summary

After looking at so many designs by many people on thingiverse, I couldn't find a design that originally wanted, so I decided to design my own that has the functionality as I imagined. My design includes automatically centering of your spool when you adjust the spool holder, that means when you adjust from a wider spool to narrow spool, both left & right roller will move synchronized from/ to each other when you turn the knob. The main design was borrowed from Aero3D as it's a good design from the start, but lacking the auto centering of spools as I described earlier.

## Print Settings

## My Print Choice

I decided to print mine in PLA, mainly because it's cheaper and easy to print, and doesn't have a big risk of warpage if you print without a heat chamber. For my spool holder I decided to use black and white PLA as it will match my Prusa printer, but you can choose what ever color you'd like.

## Infill Config

The infill config I chose for my spool holder was 20% infill. For some people they have difficulty choosing the settings so I took the liberty and made a chart with all the necessary info for you to print the spool holder. If you follow the settings I provided correctly, you should have no problem printing and assembling it later.
(NOTE: DO NOT MESS WITH THE PARTS ORIENTATION WHEN YOU LOAD THE STL FILES INTO PRUSASLICER!)

## Assembling Of Spool Holder

To assemble the spool holder you only need 8 machine screws, 7pcs M3x11.5mm & 1pcs M3x20 hex or phillips head, If you have trouble finding correct screws for you spool holder you can use the spare screws that comes with your Prusa printer to assemble it, no nuts required, just use the screws to tap the threads inside the holes.

When you have your sliders printed, It should be a L and R on them, that indicates what side they goes on, take a look at the pictures I provide underneath to give you a better picture on how it should be assemble. The thumbwheel and base endcap has to be assembled last after the left and right slider is mounted on the spool holder base.

(NOTE: SUPERGLUE OR ANY KIND OF BONDING COMPOUND ARE NOT ALLOWED DURING ASSEMBLY OF SPOOL HOLDER! ONLY SCREWS ARE MEANT TO BE USED DURING ASSEMBLING!)
